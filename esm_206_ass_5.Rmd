### Introduction

### Data and Methods

### Results

#### Results A: Visually compare annual salamander counts in old growth (OG) and clear cut (CC) sections of Mack Creek

```{r}
# Find total annual counts for two different sections of Mack Creek

vertebrates_section <- vertebrates %>% 
  select(year, section) %>% 
  group_by(year, section) %>% 
  count(section)

# Graph changes in counts over time for both sections

ggplot(data = vertebrates_section, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = section)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = section)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "salamander count",
       y = "year",
       title = "Change in salamaner counts from 1987-2017 in old growth and clear cut forests")
